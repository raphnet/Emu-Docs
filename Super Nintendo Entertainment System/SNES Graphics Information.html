<p>I've almost reached a point where my doc is a total drop-in replacement
for Yoshi's v2.30 document, which hasn't been updated in years.&nbsp; It's
a shame that we emu authors have had to put up with that document and it
was no small task to write something better.

</p><p>This repeats most everything contained in Yoshi's doc, but expands on
it in much greater detail, in better and less ambiguous English.&nbsp;
Since it is in HTML, it's got plenty of cross-references.&nbsp; I, myself,
read this document when I can't remember something about the SNES.&nbsp;
It is designed as a sort of compromise, intended to be read by both SNES
developers and emulator authors.

</p><p>It used to cover only graphics, but now also covers DMA, HDMA, Indirect
HDMA, joypad registers (including the old-style reading method, which is
not covered by Yoshi's doc), and Windowing.

</p><p>Note: Unless otherwise stated, all 16-bit number values in this document
should be assumed to be in big-endian (is that what it's called?) format,
where the least significant byte occupies the lower memory location and
the high byte occupies the following memory location.

<ul>
<li>
PPU: Picture processing unit. It is the thing that takes your SNES graphics
data and turns it into an image on the TV screen.</li>

<li>
VRAM: Video RAM. 64K of memory where tiles and tile maps are stored</li>

<li>
Registers: Memory-mapped I/O ports used for sending data and commands to
the PPU.</li>

<li>
OAM (also known as OBJ, object, or sprite info): Information about the
sprites on the screen, or the memory that contains this information. OAM
stands for "Object Attribute Memory".</li>

<li>
CG: Color palette data, or the memory that stores it. There are 256 palette
entries which contain the 15-bit absolute color levels.</li>

<li>
SC: Screen. Usually refers to the tile map for a BG, which is stored in
VRAM.</li>

<li>
BG: Background. There are up to 4 BGs, or "layers", of tiles that form
the basis of SNES graphics. These BGs can be scrolled, and a special type
of BG, in "Mode 7", can be scaled and rotated and stuff to look 3-D.&nbsp;
Sometimes the term "plane" (scrolling plane, as opposed to color plane)
is used (BG1=Plane 0, BG2=Plane 1, etc.)</li>

<li>
Sprites: Everybody knows what these are, come on. They are the little (well,
they can be up to 64x64 pixels on the SNES) graphics usually used for individual
moving objects in a game.</li>

<li>
Tile map (a.k.a. BG Matrix): A BG is made up of hundreds of tiles, which
are simply little graphics of a certain size (8x8, and 16x16 which is made
of 4 8x8 tiles) placed end-to-end. A tile map is a two-dimensional array
which contains a tile number and other properties for each square on the
BG. Note that, depending on the context, the word "tile" may refer to the
two-byte entry in the tile map, or else data for an 8x8 graphic character.</li>

<li>
Character: the graphic data (pixels) for a tile.</li>

<li>
Priority: Attribute that determines, or helps to determine, the order in
which BGs and sprites are drawn on the screen.</li>
</ul>

<center><a name="PPUMemoryTypes"></a><font size="+2">Types of PPU Memory</font></center>


<p>There are three memory areas where different kinds of graphics data
are stored, as well as the registers (located in the reserved 65816 address
space between $2000 and $5FFF) which set certain screen parameters.

</p><p>The main data area is the VRAM, a 64 KB memory space that can be accessed
with registers <a href="#Reg2115">$2115</a>, $<a href="#Reg2116">2116</a>,
$<a href="#Reg2118">2118</a>, and $<a href="#Reg2139">2139</a>.&nbsp; This
area is used for storing all the tiles used in your game, as well as the
tile maps.

</p><p>The second data area, the OAM, is used to store properties of the sprites.
It includes information about position, size, priority, etc. There can
be 128 objects maximum, and the memory is 544 bytes: the first 512 bytes
have four bytes of information per sprite, and the last 32 bytes have two
more bits of information.&nbsp; Two or more sprites can share the same
set of tiles.

</p><p>The third area is the CGRAM, where the palette data is stored. It is
512 bytes: two bytes, and fifteen bits, for each of the 256 on-screen colors.
There are five bits for each primary color (red, green, and blue).

<p><a name="BGBasics"></a><font size="+1">Basics of BGs</font>

</p><p>In <a href="#PPUMemoryTypes">VRAM</a> there is a two-dimensional array
that is a <a href="#Terminology">map</a> of the tiles on the screen. Depending
on the setting of <a href="#Reg2107">registers $2107 to $210A</a>, this
map may be 32x32, 32x64, 64x32 or 64x64 tiles in size (see a note in the
register description about the format of maps larger than 32 tiles wide
or high).&nbsp; Each of the entries in this map contain the following data:
</p><pre>High&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Low&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Legend-&gt;&nbsp; c: Starting character (tile) number
vhopppcc cccccccc&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; h: horizontal flip&nbsp; v: vertical flip
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; p: palette number&nbsp;&nbsp; o: priority bit</pre>
The character number indexes into an "array of tiles" starting at a base
VRAM location selected by <a href="#Reg210B">registers $210B or $210C</a>.
The byte address in VRAM where the character data starts can be found using
the following calculation:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; address_of_character = (base_location_bits &lt;&lt;
13) + (8 * color_depth * character_number);
<br>This formula works in both 8x8 and <a href="#Reg2107">16x16 tile mode</a>.&nbsp;
For example, if base location 1 is selected, the color depth for the tile
map is 4 bits (16 colors), and character number 1 is selected, the address
will be (1&lt;&lt;13)+8*4*1 = 8224.
<br>Note that the word address entered into the <a href="#Reg2116">VRAM
address register</a> will be half of that, or 4112.

<p>Except when using 256-color <a href="#Terminology">BGs</a>, the palette
bits determine what colors in the <a href="#Terminology">CGRAM</a> will
be mapped to the colors in the character. The number formed by the palette
bits is multiplied by the number of colors in the BG to get the starting
index in the color palette. For example, if palette 3 is selected in 16
color mode, the tile's colors will range from CG entries 48 to 63.&nbsp;
However, entry #48 will be unused since this is mapped from color 0, which
is always the 'transparent color'.&nbsp; Notice that, except in a 256-color
mode, it is not possible to select colors above 127.&nbsp; That's okay;
the sprites use these colors.&nbsp; Also, except in Mode 0 (see <a href="#Reg2105">register
$2105</a>), four color BGs may only use colors 1 to 31.

</p><p>The horizontal and vertical flip bits, if set to 1, will cause the characters
to be mirrored when shown on the screen, so that they are facing the opposite
direction. When in 16x16 tile mode, the entire tile is flipped (pixel 0
is swapped with pixel 15) rather than the individual 8x8 sub tiles being
flipped.

</p><p>The <a href="#Terminology">priority</a> bit has the effect of deciding
whether a given tile is 'on top of' or behind other BGs and sprites.&nbsp;
For more information on the drawing order, see bit 3 of <a href="#Reg2105">register
$2105</a>.

</p><p><a name="SpriteBasics"></a><font size="+1">Basics of sprites</font>

</p><p>All SNES <a href="#Terminology">sprites</a> are 16 colors.&nbsp; The
SNES can have two sizes of sprites on the screen at once; the two sizes
are selected with bits 5-7 of <a href="#Reg2101">register $2101</a>.&nbsp;
The <a href="#Terminology">character data</a> for sprites is stored in
<a href="#PPUMemoryTypes">VRAM</a>, in the same format as <a href="#Terminology">BG</a>
tiles.&nbsp; Two or more sprites can share the same set of tiles.&nbsp;
When the sprites are larger than 8x8, they are arranged in columns, followed
by rows of 8x8 tiles.&nbsp; For example, a 32x32 sprite is stored like
this:
</p><pre>Byte Offset&nbsp; 0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 64&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 96&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 128&nbsp;&nbsp; 160&nbsp;&nbsp; 192&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 224&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 256&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... et cetera.
Tile Coord&nbsp;&nbsp; (0,0) (8,0) (16,0) (24,0) (0,8) (8,8) (16,8) (24,8) (0,16) ... and so on.</pre>
Now that you've consumed the above information, realize that it is not
completely correct.&nbsp; The SNES has one more display quirk that is thrown
into the mix: all of the rows must be stored 16 tiles apart (i.e. 512 bytes,
or 256 words.)&nbsp; This means that, if there was one 32x32 sprite in
VRAM, it would have to be stored like this:
<pre>Offset&nbsp; Y-coord. Tile Coord
0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0-7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (0, 0) (8, 0) (16, 0) (24, 0) &lt;Unused--room for 12 more tiles&gt;
512&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8-15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (0, 8) (8, 8) (16, 8) (24, 8) &lt;Unused--room for 12 more tiles&gt;
1024&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16-23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (0,16) (8,16) (16,16) (24,16) &lt;Unused--room for 12 more tiles&gt;
1536&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 24-31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (0,24) (8,24) (16,24) (24,24) &lt;Unused&gt;</pre>
In practice, the sprites are interleaved.&nbsp; In other words, when using
32x32 tiles, there would be 3 more sprites stored in that "unused" space.&nbsp;
If the first sprite, shown in the above table, started at offset 0, the
next sprite would start at offset 128 (the <a href="#SpriteBasics_CharNum">Character
Number</a>, in <a href="#PPUMemoryTypes">OAM</a>, would be 4); the third
sprite would start at offset 256 (Character #8), and the fourth sprite
would start at offset 384 (Character #12).&nbsp; If a fifth sprite was
desired, the pattern would repeat and it would be located at offset 2048
(Character #64).

<p>Similarly, when using 16x16 sprites, there will be 8 sprites interleaved,
and the ninth sprite will have to start after them at offset 1024.&nbsp;
Finally, 64x64 sprites have only two sprites interleaved.&nbsp; It is also
possible to format it such that larger sprites can be interleaved with
smaller sprites, but that is somewhat confusing to try to explain.

</p><p>In OAM there are two tables which control the position, size, mirroring,
palette, and priority of sprites.&nbsp; This table has room for 128 entries;
thus, the SNES can display up to 128 sprites on the screen at once (although
I think a real SNES will overload and screw up its display when there are
too many large sprites.)&nbsp; The first table has four bytes per sprite,
and is formatted like this:
</p><pre>Byte 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxxxxxxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x: X coordinate
Byte 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yyyyyyyy&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; y: Y coordinate
Byte 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cccccccc&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c: starting character (tile) number&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; p: palette number
Byte 4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vhoopppc&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; v: vertical flip&nbsp;&nbsp; h: horizontal flip&nbsp; o: priority bits
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note: the 'c' in byte 4 is the MOST significant bit in the 9-bit char #.</pre>
The second table is 32 bytes and has 2 bits for each sprite (each byte
contains information for 4 sprites.)&nbsp; The lowest significant bits
hold the information for the lower object numbers (for example, the least
significant two bits of the first byte are for object #0.)&nbsp; Bit 0
(and 2, 4, 6) is the size toggle bit (see bits 5-7 of <a href="#Reg2101">register
$2101</a>) and bit 1 (3, 5, 7) is the most ignificant bit of the X coordinate.

<p>The vertical and horizontal flips work similarly to flips in the BGs;
the entire sprite is flipped so that the leftmost pixel is swapped with
the rightmost pixel, etc.&nbsp; To see the effect of the priority bits,
see the description of <a href="#Reg2105">register $2105</a>.&nbsp; The
palettes start at CG entry 128, so that palette 0 is colors 128 to 143,
and palette 1 consists of colors 144 to 159.

</p><p><a name="SpriteBasics_CharNum"></a>The character number indexes into
an array of 8x8 tiles starting at a base VRAM location selected by bits
0-2 of <a href="#Reg2101">register $2101</a>. The byte address in VRAM
where the character data starts can be found using the following calculation:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; address_of_character = (base_location_bits &lt;&lt;
14) + (32 * character_number);
<br>For example, if base location 1 is selected, and character number 1
is selected, the address will be 16384+32*1 = 16416.&nbsp; Note that the
word address entered into the <a href="#Reg2116">VRAM address register</a>
will be half of that, or 8208.

</p><p>Notice that two or more sprites in the OAM table may have the same character
number; if this is the case, they will look the same except that they can
be mirrored independently and have different palettes.

</p><p><a name="ColorPalettes"></a><font size="+1">Color palettes</font>

</p><p>Once the final color value is derived from the character data and 'palette
number' for the sprite or <a href="#Terminology">BG</a>, it is indexed
into the <a href="#PPUMemoryTypes">CGRAM</a> color palette array.&nbsp;
There are 512 bytes of CGRAM, with each of the 256 colors using two bytes.&nbsp;
Each of the palette entries is formatted like this:
</p><pre>?bbbbbgg gggrrrrr&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?: Unused and ignored&nbsp; b: Blue intensity
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; g: Green intensity&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; r: Red intensity</pre>
(Notice this is backwards to the conventional RGB format.)&nbsp; To upload
palette entries to CGRAM, select the color with register $2121, and then
begin sending the bytes to <a href="#Reg2122">register $2122</a>.
<br>&nbsp;
<center><a name="GraphicsFormat"></a><font size="+3">The SNES Graphics Format</font></center>


<p>All SNES graphics (except in <a href="#Terminology">BG</a>1 of Mode
7) are made up of <a href="#Terminology">Tiles</a>, also called character
data.&nbsp; The basic tile is 8x8 in size, and larger bitmaps are stored
in the form of two-dimensional arrays of these small tiles.&nbsp; On most
computers, bitmaps are stored in a packed format: the color bits are grouped
together in the same byte (or word, or dword, for high-color displays.)&nbsp;
However, SNES graphics are planar; that is, the each of the color bits
are stored separately.&nbsp; Each color plane of the tile is stored like
this:
</p><pre>byte 0:&nbsp;&nbsp; top scanline&nbsp;&nbsp; 01234567
byte 2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 01234567&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; right
byte 4:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; left&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 01234567&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; side
byte 6:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; side&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 01234567&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of
byte 8:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 01234567&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tile
byte 10:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tile&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 01234567&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
byte 12:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 01234567&nbsp; Note that left/right and top/bottom can
byte 14: bottom scanline 01234567&nbsp; be reversed using the BG/sprite flip bits.</pre>
Planes 0 and 1 are stored first, followed by planes 2 and 3, etc.&nbsp;
As you can see, the bytes in each plane are two bytes apart; the byte "in
between" is the following plane.&nbsp; In other words, byte 0 stores the
first eight pixels of plane 0 and byte 1 stores the first eight pixels
of plane 1.&nbsp; If using more than 4 colors, the pattern repeats; byte
16 stores the first eight pixels of plane 2 and byte 17 stores the first
eight pixels of plane 3.

<p>When the tile is to be displayed on the screen, a bit is taken from
each of the planes to form a 2-, 4-, or 8-bit value to index into the <a href="#ColorPalettes">color
palette</a>.&nbsp; The first tile (plane 0) contains the least significant
bit of the color, and the last tile contains the most significant bit.

</p><p><a name="Mode7GrFormat"></a><font size="+1">Mode 7 Graphics Representation</font>

</p><p>In Mode 7, both the tile map and the tiles themselves are stored differently.&nbsp;
In fact, the tile data and the graphic data are interleaved.&nbsp; The
first byte (low byte) is an element of the tile map, and the second byte
(high byte) is the color value of a pixel.
</p><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First Byte&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second Byte
Bits&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7&nbsp; 6&nbsp; 5&nbsp; 4&nbsp; 3&nbsp; 2&nbsp; 1&nbsp; 0&nbsp; 15 14 13 12 11 10 9&nbsp; 8
Contains&nbsp; Tile Number&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Graphics data</pre>
The Mode 7 screen data occupies all of the first 32 KB of VRAM: 16K is
for graphics data, and 16K is for the tile numbers.&nbsp; The tile map
format is simply the tile number with no other information, and takes one
byte.&nbsp; The dimensions of the tile map are 128x128 (=16384 bytes).&nbsp;
Unlike all other screen modes, the graphics data is a packed, linear format
and each color value directly indexes into CGRAM.&nbsp; The tiles are still
8x8 pixels, and thus take 64 bytes per tile.&nbsp; There are 256 characters
in total.&nbsp; The calculation to find which character to display is simply
64 * Tile_Number.

<p>A variation of Mode 7, EXTBG (see bit 6 of register $2133), cuts the
colors down to 128 and uses the most significant color bit as a priority
bit.

<p>This section may not be quite accurate.&nbsp; Please tell me if you
find an error.&nbsp; W means writeable; R means readable.&nbsp; 2b means
the register is one word in size;&nbsp; Db means that it is a one-byte
register that must be written or read twice.&nbsp; In contrast to the Y0shi
Doc, auto-incrementing registers such as <a href="#Reg2122">$2122</a> are
not considered Db registers, because they can be written any number of
times (writing one byte will work just as well as writing two, or writing
a hundred.)

This register selects the location in VRAM where the character data is
stored, and the size of sprites on the screen.&nbsp; The byte location
of the character data can be found by shifting the b (base selection) bits
left by 14.&nbsp; Note that this allows only four different locations in
VRAM to put the sprite data; the high bit of the base selection should

This register selects the byte location to begin uploading (or downloading)

<p>I'm sorta guessing, but I think that the priority rotation thing is
applied by SNES games to keep sprites on the screen.&nbsp; That is, when
there are too many sprites on the screen at once I believe the SNES will
turn certain sprites off in order to reduce the load on the PPU.&nbsp;
So I think the SNES takes the "a" bits, shifts them right one and the result
is which sprite to re-activate.&nbsp; In the process another sprite gets
turned off.&nbsp; Another possibility is that it doesn't matter what address
you select, it simply picks any sprite that is off and turns it on, perhaps
simultaneously turning off a sprite that has been on for a while.

To calculate the byte location where the tile map starts, shift the a (address)
bits left by 11 (multiply by 2048.)&nbsp; The SC size is the dimensions
of the tile map; if using 8x8 tile mode, this allows BG dimensions of 256
or 512 pixels; if in 16x16 mode, the dimensions can be 512 or 1024 pixels.&nbsp;
Note that, since there is only 64K of VRAM, the most significant bit must
be zero.

<p>When using a screen size wider than 32 tiles, the format is a little
different than you might expect.&nbsp; When the width is 64 tiles, then
rather than each line in the tile map extending to 128 bytes (instead of
64), there will actually be <i>two</i> tile maps, stored one right after
the other in memory.&nbsp; The first tile map will contain the left 32
tiles (x coordinates 0 to 255, when using 8x8 tiles), and the next tile
map will contain the right 32 tiles (x coordinates 256 to 511, when using
8x8 tiles. Setting the scroll register to 512, then, will be the same at
setting it to zero.)

</p><p>A note about using 16x16 tiles:&nbsp; These are stored in exactly the
same way as 16x16 sprites; that is, the first and second rows have 14 ignored
tiles between them.&nbsp; (At least that's how it works when in 16-color
mode; I haven't figured out if it's the same for 4 or 256 colors but it's
very likely.)

This register must be written twice to write the complete value; every
time the register is written to, an internal pointer alternates between
changing the high and low bytes.&nbsp; The first time you write to the
register, the low byte will be changed.&nbsp; There are 11 bits for the
offset; when these bits are set to 0, you will see tile map location 0
on the left/top of the screen.&nbsp; The offset is a pixel value, so adding
one will scroll the screen right by one pixel.&nbsp; When the screen is
scrolled right (or down) from 0, the rightmost (or bottommost) elements
of the tile map will come on from the left (top) of the screen.

<p>If a pixel value is placed in this register that is larger than the
width of the BG, a modulus can be performed to determine what the actual
pixel will be that is displayed.&nbsp; For example, if the BG1 horizontal
pixel value is set to 257, but the width of the BG is 256 pixels, the result
will be the same as if it was set to 1.

</p><p>The m bits are used in Mode 7 only; I don't know what they are for.&nbsp;
The only thing I've determined is that the scroll register seems to cause
pixel-based scrolling: that is, increasing this register by one will make
the screen scroll a slight amount right or down.&nbsp; (256/224 would be
one screenful.)

</p><p>Since there is only one BG in Mode 7, the 'm' bits apply only to registers

<p>The SNES' Windowing registers are used for clipping; that is, cutting
off portions of the screen.&nbsp; If you run Mario World, you'll notice
a "circular opening" on the opening screen.&nbsp; This is done using windowing,
which clips off the parts of the screen outside of the window.&nbsp; The
clipping is only applied to BG1, BG2 and sprites, so that the big letters
"Mario World" (BG3) are always visible.&nbsp; Windowing has only a left
and right value, so what Mario World and many other games do is constantly
vary the left and right values using HDMA.

an IRQ is generated.&nbsp; Horizontal IRQs are rarely used, because of
the high frequency (every scanline) of the interrupts.

use SEI to prevent recursive calling, then read from this register to "un-apply"

This register is pretty simple; it returns whether in a vertical/horizontal
blank period (1=yes) and whether the joypad is ready to be read from registers
$4218 to $421F.&nbsp; The horizontal blank time lasts from "pixels" 256
to 339. (Not really pixels, since nothing is being drawn.)&nbsp; In zSNES,
<i>apparently</i>, the joypad becomes ready to be read once every frame,
and more specifically, scanline 227 (might not be a constant.)&nbsp; How
this bit gets cleared to 0, however, is unknown.

<p>A loop in the "leftover" demo suggests that the joypad bit is backwards;
that is, a value of 1 indicates the joypad is <i>not</i> ready.&nbsp; I
think some other demos suggest the opposite is true, though.&nbsp; Interestingly
enough, the demos still work regardless of their treatment of the bit.&nbsp;
Hmmm...

then these registers simply return whether the joypad is connected (0=Not

to write a 0 before this function works.

</p><p>To use the old-style reading method, bit 0 of register $4200 must be
clear (probably to prevent conflict between the manual reading and the
SNES' automatic reading.)&nbsp; Like on the NES, two values should be written
before reading starts: a 1 followed by a 0.&nbsp; This "activates a strobe
in the joypad circuitry."&nbsp; Apparently, but not for certain, it is

register may contain the value pointer minus one in regular HDMA (e.g.

</p><p>This isn't a DMA register at all, but is often used in conjunction with
DMA to do memory-to-memory or memory-fill operations.&nbsp; This is a fairly
simple register, but I'm documenting it here because it's not fully covered

to the specified address, and every time a read/write occurs, the address
part of the register is incremented by one, including the MSB.

</p><p>Important: The x bits (address) seem to actually form a RAM address,
NOT a CPU address.&nbsp; Therefore, the highest 7 bits of the register
are ignored, since the SNES has only 128 KB of RAM.

</p><p><a name="DMATransfers"></a><font size="+3">DMA Transfer Basics</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>First of all, here's a list of DMA (Direct Memory Access) registers:

</p><p>$43?0: DMA control register
<br>$43?1: DMA destination register ($21xx)
<br>$43?2/$43?3/$43?4: DMA source address
<br>$43?5/$43?6: Number of bytes to transfer
<br>$420B: Start DMA transfer
<br>$420C: Enable HDMA transfers

</p><p>There are 8 DMA channels, numbered 0 to 7.&nbsp; Simply replace the
question mark with the number of the channel you want to use.&nbsp; Each
channel can be used independently of the others.

</p><p>There are two basic types of DMA: DMA and HDMA.&nbsp; Normal DMA is
quite straightforward. The SNES program simply puts a source address into
$43?2, a destination address into $43?1 and the number of bytes to copy
into $43?5.&nbsp; The reason $43?1 is only a one-byte register is because
the high byte is always $21; e.g. if you set it to $18, the transfer destination
will be $2118.&nbsp; The <a href="#Reg43x0">DMA control register</a> controls
how the bytes will be transferred.&nbsp; Using the previous example, setting
it to one(1) will cause bytes written to alternate between $2118 and $2119.&nbsp;
Use $43?0 to start a transfer.&nbsp; For instance, if you were using DMA
channel 1 ($4310, etc.), you would set bit one in that register. (e.g.
LDA #$2 \ STA $420B.)

</p><p>HDMA is a powerful, and largely undocumented, tool for generating special
effects. It is used often by commercial games and demos alike.&nbsp; Its
most common use is to change one or more of the scroll registers mid-frame;
some games also change the video mode or palette mid-frame with it.&nbsp;
It is set up similar to DMA, except that $43?5 is ignored and probably,
bits 3, 4, 5 and 7 of $43?0 are ignored.

</p><p><b>Normal HDMA</b>

</p><p>There are two types of HDMA, controlled by bit 6 of register $43?0.&nbsp;
"Normal" HDMA is the simplest.

</p><p>The source address register points to an "HDMA table".&nbsp; Such a
table consists of a list of "delay counts" and "write values".&nbsp; For
example, consider the following HDMA table, which is an abridgement of
what I use in my demo QwertEmu.smc.&nbsp; It the destination is the BG1
scroll register.

</p><p><tt>hdma_table:</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .dcb 3 : .dcw 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
; This makes the cool wavey BG effect.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .dcb 4 : .dcw 2</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .dcb 6 : .dcw 3</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .dcb 7 : .dcw 4</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .dcb 6 : .dcw 3</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .dcb 4 : .dcw 2</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .dcb 3 : .dcw 1</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .dcb 2 : .dcw 0</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .dcb 3 : .dcw 511</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .dcb 4 : .dcw 510</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .dcb 6 : .dcw 509</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .dcb 7 : .dcw 508</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .dcb 6 : .dcw 509</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .dcb 4 : .dcw 510</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .dcb 3 : .dcw 511</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .dcb 2 : .dcw 0</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .dcb 0</tt>

</p><p>The first value is the scanline count, and the second is the value to
write.&nbsp; So, after I set up the addresses and set $420C to 1 to enable
the HDMA transfer, the SNES (I think) will wait until the beginning of
the next frame before executing this transfer.&nbsp; In the example above,
two bytes are written, because the transfer is using mode 2 (i.e. 1 reg
write twice, which is the proper way to set a scroll register.)&nbsp; The
first byte written is the LSByte (1) followed by the MSByte (0).&nbsp;
The first value is written in scanline 0; the first value is written at
scanline 0 regardless of the count value.&nbsp; After this, the SNES waits
three more scanlines (according to the count value of 3) before writing
a $0002 to the scroll register.&nbsp; Eventually, the SNES will come across
the wait value of $0, which indicates to the SNES that the table is over
and the transfering should stop.&nbsp; The SNES will automatically restart
the HDMA transfer at the beginning of the table next frame.

</p><p>Note:&nbsp; Transfers probably do not stop at the VBlank period.&nbsp;
That is, if the table is so long that it lasts into the VBlank period,
transferring will still continue (this is unconfirmed though).&nbsp; If
the table is so long that the next frame starts before a $0 has been encountered,
the SNES will reset the transfer from the beginning anyway.

</p><p><b>Indirect HDMA</b>

</p><p>Most of the properties of regular HDMA also apply to Indirect HDMA:
Indirect HDMA has a count value, the transfer modes are the same, and Indirect
HDMA tables are also reset to the beginning at the beginning of each frame.

</p><p>An Indirect HDMA table is formatted like this:

</p><p>Count Byte/Address Offset/Count Byte/Address Offset/Count Byte/Address
Offset...

</p><p>So, instead of having the values to write directly located in the HDMA
table, they are accessed via the Address Offset pointer.&nbsp; Let's go
through an example.&nbsp; If register $43?2 is set to $1289AB, and register
$43?1 is set to $05, here is the table (this is similar to a table used
by Metroid 3 in the opening level):

</p><p><tt>Memory at $1289AB (Hex)</tt>
<br><tt>1F 01 03 57 02 03 00</tt>

</p><p>The second and third bytes are used as pointers to values to write.&nbsp;
The bank value after indirection must be set manually by the SNES program
via register $4307.&nbsp; Metroid 3 uses a bank value of $12 so the table
points to $120301 and $120302, respectively.&nbsp; If the memory contained
at $120301 is (Hex):

</p><p><tt>09 07</tt>

</p><p>The $9 will be written at the beginning of scanline 0, and after $1F
(31) scanlines, $7 will be written. This makes sense when you run the game;
the status bar at the top is shown in video mode 1, while below it is a
mode 7 screen.

</p><p>If you think using HDMA in this way is rather useless, you are correct.&nbsp;
There's no reason this couldn't be done using normal HDMA, but many games
use indirect HDMA anyway.&nbsp; The nice thing about it is that you can
store the count values and pointers in ROM, and the actual values to write
(which may be variable) in RAM.&nbsp; Thus the same basic ROM table can
be re-used with different data sets.

</p><p><b>Continuous Mode</b>

</p><p>This mode adds an extremely annoying twist to the job of writing an
emulator.&nbsp; It can be used in both normal and indirect HDMA.&nbsp;
To use this mode, set bit 7 of the count value to 1.*

</p><p>Continuous mode means that a value is written every single scanline
rather than waiting for the count value to expire.&nbsp; I'll provide two
examples, one for normal and one for indirect HDMA.&nbsp; Assume the transfer
mode is 1 (One byte write once.)&nbsp; If your count value is 4, then in
normal HDMA, a segment of your table would look something like this:

</p><p><tt>84 01 02 03 04</tt>
<br><tt>^&nbsp; ^^-^^-^^-^^--These are the values to write</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;--This is the count value with a continuous mode flag</tt>

</p><p>But in an Indirect HDMA version of this, the table segment would look
something like:

</p><p><tt>84 34 12</tt>

</p><p>And the memory at $1234 would contain:

</p><p><tt>01 02 03 04</tt>

</p><p>* There may be an exception.&nbsp; If the count value is exactly $80,
it may not mean to use continuous mode, but rather have a count value of

</p><p><b>HDMA Priorities</b>

</p><p>Lower HDMA channel numbers have a high priority.&nbsp; That is, if you
have two tables running at the same time:

</p><p><tt>hdma_table_channel_0:</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .dcb 10 : .dcb 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
; Suppose that this table is used to set the</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .dcb 0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
; palette index ($2121) to 1 using mode 0</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
; N.B.: depending on the mode used, the value</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
; to transfer may be a byte, word or dword.&nbsp; In</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
; mode 0, only a byte is transferred at once.</tt>
<br><tt>hdma_table_channel_1:</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .dcb 10 :.dcw $8FFF
; Suppose that this table is used to set the</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .dcb 0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
; palette value ($2122) using mode 2</tt>

</p><p>In this example, at scanline #9, the palette index register will be
set <i>before</i> the palette value is written.&nbsp; If you reversed the
channel numbers, however, the transfer might not occur correctly.

</p><p>Please note that some of the HDMA information is inaccurate, as evidenced
by the fact that my emu doesn't emulate it properly!

<p>Gad! That took long enough to write.
